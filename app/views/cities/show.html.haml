        %li You and 3-5 strangers sit down together
        %li 
          For 2 hours or so, we ask questions, share stories,
          and listen
        %li
          We create serendipity out of nothing.
        %li
          We sit there and wonder how this doesn't happen more often
        %li
          Maybe we become friends. Maybe not. That's cool too.

        Tea time creates space for neighbors to sit together and try to
        understand each other.
      %p It's just a really good conversation.
